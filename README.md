# Hotel Reservation System
 
To run the website, do the following simple steps:

1) Download and install XAMPP.
2) Open XAMPP and start the services. In windows, Apache and MySQL would be enough. Open the xampp2 folder --> htdocs --> copy and past the files there. 
2.1) On a mac, just click start all. On the network tab, enable port 8080, then finally at the volumes tab, select mount to access lamp folder. 
3) Open the lamp folder --> htdocs --> copy and past the files there. The website should be up and running on a browser.

On either OS, you can run them now by simply typing 'localhost:8080/downloaded_folder_name'
